# Get Dependabot Alerts in org 
This repo demonstrates how to use the GitHub REST API and GraphQL APIs to export all the dependabot alerts on an organization to a CSV file. This makes it possible for a security team to quickly audit the known vulnerabilities of dependencies across their organizations that are using GitHub Advanced Security
